**Aerial Cows** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 1723 images with 15860 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cow*).

Each image in the Aerial Cows dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 642 (37% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (299 images), *valid* (340 images), and *train* (1084 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/omarkapur-berkeley-edu/).
